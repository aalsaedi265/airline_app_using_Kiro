# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an interactive airline simulation web application that provides a comprehensive flight management experience. The system will simulate core airline services including real-time flight tracking, booking management, check-in services, and premium features, all powered by live flight and weather data APIs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to view real-time flight information on a live flight board, so that I can track departures and arrivals at Chicago O'Hare airport.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the flight board loads THEN the system SHALL display live flight data with airline, flight number, destination/origin, scheduled times, estimated times, status, gate, and terminal information
2. WHEN flight data is updated from external APIs THEN the system SHALL refresh the display in real-time using SignalR
3. WHEN a user searches for flights THEN the system SHALL filter results by airline, flight number, destination, or status
4. WHEN flight status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display with appropriate status indicators (On-Time, Delayed, Boarding, Cancelled)
5. WHEN the system cannot retrieve flight data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a traveler, I want to see weather information for flight destinations, so that I can understand potential weather-related delays or conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing flight details THEN the system SHALL display current weather conditions for both origin and destination cities
2. WHEN weather data is available THEN the system SHALL show temperature, conditions, visibility, and wind information

4. WHEN severe weather conditions exist THEN the system SHALL highlight potential weather-related flight impacts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to create an account and manage my profile, so that I can book flights and track my travel history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL require email, password, first name, last name, and phone number
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials and create a secure session
3. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate and save changes to the database
4. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link via email
5. WHEN user session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page and preserve intended destination

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to book flights through an integrated booking engine, so that I can purchase tickets directly from the flight board.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user selects a seat class THEN the system SHALL show a visual seat map for seat selection
3. WHEN a user selects specific seats THEN the system SHALL reserve those seats temporarily during the booking process
4. WHEN a user proceeds to payment THEN the system SHALL integrate with a simulated payment gateway
5. WHEN payment is completed THEN the system SHALL generate a booking confirmation number and store booking details
6. WHEN booking fails THEN the system SHALL release reserved seats and display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a passenger, I want to check in for my flight using my confirmation number, so that I can complete pre-flight requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a booking confirmation number THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display booking details
2. WHEN check-in is available (24 hours before departure) THEN the system SHALL allow the user to complete check-in
3. WHEN check-in is completed THEN the system SHALL generate a boarding pass with seat assignment and gate information
4. WHEN check-in is not yet available THEN the system SHALL display the time when check-in opens
5. WHEN an invalid confirmation number is entered THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a passenger, I want to receive notifications about flight changes, so that I can stay informed about delays, gate changes, and other updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opts in for notifications THEN the system SHALL allow selection of email and/or SMS notification preferences
2. WHEN flight status changes occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications to opted-in passengers via their preferred method
3. WHEN gate changes occur THEN the system SHALL immediately notify affected passengers
4. WHEN flights are delayed or cancelled THEN the system SHALL send timely notifications with updated information
5. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt retry according to configured rules

### Requirement 7
